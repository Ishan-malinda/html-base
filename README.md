# HTML Base 🌐

A comprehensive collection of HTML5 foundational elements, semantic structures, and best practices. This repository serves as a "cheat sheet" or starter kit for web development.

## 🚀 Contents

The repository currently includes a core reference file:
* **`basics.html`**: A structured guide covering:
    * **Text Formatting**: Headings, paragraphs, and specialized text tags.
    * **Multimedia**: Implementation of `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` with controls.
    * **Forms**: Input types, labels, fieldsets, and validation.
    * **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for SEO and accessibility.
    * **Advanced Elements**: Iframes, tables, and HTML entities.

## 🛠️ Usage

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/html-base.git](https://github.com/your-username/html-base.git)
    ```
2.  Open `basics.html` in any modern web browser to view the rendered elements.

## 📝 Key Learning Notes
* **Semantic Elements**: Always use tags like `<article>` and `<section>` to improve accessibility and SEO.
* **Accessibility**: Always include `alt` attributes for images to support screen readers.
* **Responsiveness**: The `<meta name="viewport">` tag is included to ensure the site is mobile-friendly.
